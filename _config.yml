about_me_description: >
  <p>Interested in Machine Learning, Genomics, Open Science and the Web.</p>

  <p>Scientist by education and programmer by profession. Over the years, I've coded mostly in Node.js (JavaScript), Python, R, and Shell scripting to analyse Big Genomic Data.</p>

  <p>Founded and lead Bionode.io, an Open Source community to build scalable code and tools for bioinformatics by leveraging Node.js.</p>

  <p>In 2016, the Mozilla Science Lab awarded me a fellowship (one of four, out of 483 submissions) to travel around the world and champion open science through workshops and hackathons.</p>

  <p>Reproducibility and scalability are important to me, thus I've also become an expert in Docker, Singularity, Nix (package manager) and cloud computing.</p>

  <p>Worked for research labs and startups, I enjoy being at the intersection of industry and academia.</p>
